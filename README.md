E-Commerce Storefront
This is a basic e-commerce web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks used. It includes a product list with search and filters, a product detail view, and a cart that saves to localStorage. Users can log in with any name, and logging in as "admin" unlocks an admin dashboard with options to add, edit, or delete products. The app is responsive and runs entirely in a single HTML file for easy setup and use.
